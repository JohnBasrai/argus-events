we don't want
src/repository/memory/mod.rs,x.rx...
src/repository/postgres/mod.rs,x.rx...
src/repository/redits/mod.rs,x.rx...

To allow for more scalability?  Or is that overkill, and we can do
refactor if it every becomes an issue?  This is my we use EMBP (public
interface of entire repository tree is in repository/mod.rs).

🔁 Recommended Coding Approach
We'll work module-by-module, one small unit at a time, with checkpoints after each:

Step	Module	Goal	Lines	Review?
1	domain/	Define Event, EventQuery, trait	~60–80	✅ Yes
2	repository/	memory.rs in-memory impl	~60–80	✅ Yes
3	api/	POST /events handler	~60	✅ Yes
4	api/	GET /events?... handler	~70	✅ Yes
5	metrics/	Define and expose basic counters	~30–40	✅ Yes
6	main.rs	Wire it all together	~40–50	✅ Yes
7	tests/	Integration test + unit test scaffold	~50–100	✅ Yes
